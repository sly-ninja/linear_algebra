Vector Addition

    Is commutative. That is, for all vectors x + y = y + x

    Is associative. That is, for all vectors (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)
    
    Has the zero vector as an identity. For all vectors x + 0 = 0 + x,
    where 0 is the vector of size n with 0 for each component.
    
    Has an inverse, -x. That is x + (-x) = 0


The dot product of vectors

    Is commutative. That is, for all vectors DOT(x, y) = DOT(y, x).
    
    Distributes over vector addition. That is, for all vectors:
    x*DOT(y, z) = DOT(x, y) + DOT(x, z)
    DOT((x + y), z) = DOT(x, z) + DOT(y, z)

Other Properties

    DOT((x + y), (x + y)) = DOT(x, x) + 2*DOT(x, y) + DOT(y, y)
    
    DOT(x, y) = 0 if and only if x and y are orthogonal.
